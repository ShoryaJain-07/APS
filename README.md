Approach:

Use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path between the customer's location and all available drivers.

Choose the driver with the minimum path distance.

This reduces the wait time by ensuring that the closest driver is always chosen.

For the ride matching use weighted sum model, weights can be assigned to the three factors as follows:

Distance of Driver from Customer: Weight = 0.5

Driver Rating: Weight = 0.3

Idle Time of Driver: Weight = 0.2

These weights can be adjusted based on the priorities and requirements of the service. The weighted sum can then be calculated as:

Score=(0.5×Distance)+(0.3×Rating)+(0.2×Idle Time)

The driver with the highest score can be assigned to the customer.
